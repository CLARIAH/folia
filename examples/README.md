# FoLiA examples

This directory contains FoLiA example documents. These examples serve two purposes:

1) As an example of how FoLiA works for human-end users. Note that this is no substitute for the official documentation!
2) As input for automated tests by FoLiA libraries and other FoLiA tools

The numbers in the filenames refer to the FoLiA version used. Once made, the examples should not change.

## Contents

### Deep examples

*Deep examples are examples that refer to proper set definitions for all annotation types and therefore can be validated
on a deep level*

* ``frog-deep.1.3.2.folia.xml`` - Tokenised dutch text with part-of-speech tags, lemmas, named entities, shallow
    parsing, dependency parsing, and morphological analysis. Produced by
    [Frog](https://languagemachines.github.io/frog).

### 'Shallow' examples

*Shallow examples lack a complete set definition for at least one annotation type*

* ``arabic.0.12.folia.xml`` - A small manually-constructed example of some annotated arabic text
* ``corrections.0.12.folia.xml`` - A manually constructed example showing different kinds of orthographical correction (dutch text)
* ``full-legacy.1.5.folia.xml`` - An extensive example that shows everything FoLiA has to offer up to FoLiA v1.5 in a
    single document. The downside is this makes the example rather contrived and sometimes non-sensible.
* ``morphology.1.3.2.folia.xml`` - An example of morphology output as generated by Frog (on dutch text)
* ``textvalidation.1.5.0.folia.xml`` - An example document with text redundancy, i.e. text on multiple levels. FoLiA
    libraries are be able to validate the text consistency across the levels.

### Erroneous examples

*Erroneous examples are invalid FoLiA, they serve to either illustrate a bad practice or to use to test error handling.
FoLiA libraries and validators should never accept these documents.*

* ``erroneous/inconsistenttext.1.5.0.folia.xml``
