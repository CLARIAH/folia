# FoLiA examples

This directory contains FoLiA example documents. These examples serve two purposes:

1) As an example of how FoLiA works for human-end users. Note that this is no substitute for the official documentation!
2) As input for automated tests by FoLiA libraries and other FoLiA tools

The numbers in the filenames refer to the FoLiA version used. Once made, the examples should not change.
