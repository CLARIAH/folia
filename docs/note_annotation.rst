Description & Examples
-------------------------

The structure element ``<note>`` allows for notes to be included in FoLiA
documents. A footnote or a bibliographical reference is an example of a
note. The notes form an integral part of the text. For notes that are merely
descriptive comments on the text or its annotations, rather than a part of it,
use ``<desc>`` or ``<comment>`` instead. Notes themselves can contain all the
usual forms of annotations.

The place of a note in the text is where it will appear. References to the note
are made using a specific tag, ``<ref>``, discussed in :ref:`reference_annotation`.
