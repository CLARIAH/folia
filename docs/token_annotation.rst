Token Annotation
==================================================================

.. foliaspec:annotationtype_description(token)
This annotation type introduces a tokenisation layer for the document. The terms **token** and **word** are used interchangeably in FoLiA as FoLiA itself does not commit to a specific tokenisation paradigm. Tokenisation is a prerequisite for the majority of linguistic annotation types offered by FoLiA and it is one of the most fundamental types of Structure Annotation. The words/tokens are typically embedded in other types of structure elements, such as sentences or paragraphs.

:Extra Attributes: ``space`` -- Indicates whether a space should be inserted after this token (value ``yes``, default if not specified) or not (value ``no``).

Description & Examples
-------------------------

Tokenisation is a prerequisite for most forms of linguistic annotation. The ``<w>`` element is FoLiA's basic token or
word (hence the element's name). This element occurs in the scope of wider structural elements such as ``<s>``
(:ref:`sentence_annotation`)
