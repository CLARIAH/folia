Libraries
------------

Currently, the following FoLiA library implementations exist. Both follow a highly
object-oriented model in which FoLiA XML elements correspond with classes.

* `FoLiApy <https://github.com/proycon/foliapy>`_ - A FoLiA library in Python.
* `libfolia <https://github.com/LanguageMachines/libfolia>`_ - A FoLiA library in C++. Obtain from https://proycon.github.io/folia

Both libraries are shipped as part of our `LaMachine <https://proycon.github.io/LaMachine>`_ software
distribution.

Information regarding implementation of certain elements for these two
libraries is present in the status boxes throughout this documentation. The
following table shows the level of FoLiA support in these
libraries:

The following table lists FoLiA library implementations, the last column lists the predecessor of FoLiApy, which was
part of `PyNLPl <https://github.com/proycon/pynlpl>`_.
